TLDR: Migration from CSV to PostgresDB

- Migrated autocomplete backend from CSV to PostgreSQL database (table: post_offices).
- Improved search logic: prioritizes matches at the start of any field, then secondary matches.
- Limited search columns for performance and relevance.
- Added input length validation and error handling for robustness and security.
- Migrated CreatePath.php to use the database instead of CSV for node lookups.
- Optimized CreatePath.php to only fetch required nodes (start, finish, parents, roots) for each journey, greatly improving performance.
- Updated frontend and backend to use associative arrays for journey data.
- Added and then removed backend timing logs for performance analysis.
- Cleaned up and fully commented CreatePath.php for maintainability.
