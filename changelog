Changed the style and content of the parcel journey timeline.
Changed CSS styling
Added Index page and a new query page


problem: cannot test new input page because queryentry.html is calling map.js for map functionality
execept that it therefore reads code that only createEntry.html needs.

split map.js into multiple files so i can pick which functions to use for each page
added JS subfolders since we have so many now


now need to handle a datagrab from the tracking box. pass to a php script that searches the database for that tracking code.
it will return a list of offices it flows through. We either write a script that searches the csv foro the full data line off of this ID
or we just save the full data lines to the DB (better)
