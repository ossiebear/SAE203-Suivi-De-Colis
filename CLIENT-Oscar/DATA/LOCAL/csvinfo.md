Original file was downloaded [here](https://datanova.laposte.fr/applications/bureaux-de-poste-tableau-de-bord)

I put this file through a python filtering script to remove values i didnt need. ==> postaldata.csv

The file was then put through a hierarchy tree algorithm to find the most "important" post offices.
These top offices were then handpicked so they have good coverage of the country. ==> root_nodes.csv
